## Introduction & Rant

In today's digital age, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the **growing number of subscriptions** we need to maintain just to enjoy our favorite content. From streaming services to music apps, these recurring fees can quickly add up, leaving us feeling like **we're drowning in a sea of monthly payments**. On the other hand, opting for free versions often means being bombarded with endless advertisements, disrupting our experience and testing our patience.

**So, which would you prefer? Drowning in advertisements or drowning financially?**

Luckily, there are alternative solutions that can help you enjoy premium features without breaking the bank or enduring constant interruptions. In this article, we'll explore some of the best free alternatives available to help you take back control of your digital experience.

## Adblocks, but better !  ‚ù§Ô∏è

In today's digital world, advertisements are everywhere. While they are essential for supporting free content, they can often be intrusive and annoying. Ad blockers like AdBlock Plus and AdBlock help improve your browsing experience by blocking these unwanted ads.

However, did you know that the landscape of ad blockers has changed over the years? In 2021, the company behind AdBlock Plus, Eyeo GmbH, acquired AdBlock Inc., effectively bringing together two of the most popular ad-blocking tools under one roof. This merger aims to improve user control over online experiences by combining development resources (source: Eyeo).

Despite the benefits, there's a catch. **Major companies, including Google, can pay to have their ads whitelisted by AdBlock Plus through the "Acceptable Ads" program**. This means that some ads may still bypass the blocking mechanisms if they meet certain criteria set by Eyeo GmbH (source: The Next Web).

### uBlock Origin

uBlock Origin stands out as **the ultimate ad blocker** due to its unmatched efficiency, lightweight nature, and commitment to user privacy. Unlike other ad blockers, it doesn't allow acceptable ads, ensuring a completely ad-free experience. Its minimal use of system resources means faster page loads and smoother browsing, even on lower-powered devices. Plus, being open source, it offers complete transparency and community-driven improvements.

### SponsorBlock

And this video is sponsored by...
We all hate it, and here's a miracle plugin that **automatically skips sponsors of youtube videos** ! It's a must, especially if you spend a lot of time on Youtube.

## Spotify premium, for free !? üíö

Are you tired of hearing "wanna break from the ads?" too? This chapter is perfect for you!
Unfortunately, it's impossible to "stream audio in high quality", or even to download music, since it's not really possible to get a premium account without paying.... But, hey, no more ads, that's not bad at all!

### SpotX (Windows)

Blocks all banner, video and audio ads in the client. Hiding podcasts, episodes and audiobooks from the homepage (optional), and many more... what more can you ask for?

### xManager (Android)

Does the same thing, but for your (Android) phone!

## Netflix, Crunchyroll, ADN, Disney+ and many more... packed in a single app, for free! üì∫

Imagine having all your favorite streaming services like Netflix, Crunchyroll, Disney+, and many more, centralized in one app, and available for free. That's exactly what you get when you combine Stremio with the Torrentio add-on !

[**Stremio**](https://www.stremio.com/) is an open-source media center that allows you to watch movies, TV shows, live TV, and more from a variety of sources, all in one place. It's designed to be user-friendly and supports a wide range of add-ons that expand its capabilities.

[**Torrentio**](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) is an add-on for Stremio that pulls streaming links from torrent sites. When you search for a show or movie in Stremio, Torrentio aggregates links from torrent sources and allows you to stream content directly within the app. This means you can access a vast library of content, including titles available on popular platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Crunchyroll, Disney+, and more, all without having to subscribe to these services.

#### How to Set It Up :
- Install Stremio: Download and install Stremio on your device from Stremio's official website (or search it up on Google Play).
